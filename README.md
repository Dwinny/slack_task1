# slack_task1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This mobile application is a simple slack profile demo with a button that takes you to a webview page of your Github profile. The app is responsiveness for both a mobile screen and computer screen. I made use of the Webview flutter package. The app works by, clicking on the 'Open Github' button and it takes you straight to the webview page on the mobile app, which displays the Github Profile.
